      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This "choose your own adventure" story is powered by the npmjs package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/question-tree-core" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">question-tree-core</a> which helps determine the narrative order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story might be boring or poorly written (I hope you don't think so...) but the point wasn't really to write a story so much as it was to demonstrate the "question-tree-core" couuld be used to power a CYOA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy!
