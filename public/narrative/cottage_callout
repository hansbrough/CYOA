Before you even finish calling out you realize it’s a bit silly since you literally just saw someone in the window! So after a moment of silence you call out a second time “Hello?! I know you are there. I saw you in the window.” From inside you hear a wooden scraping noise - possibly furniture being moved across the floor (?) It’s hard to tell from outside.

Working up your courage you move to the small front landing and nervously peer through the door. What you see is an unremarkable room with broad, rough hewn, floor boards, a few pieces of simple, care worn furniture, a bookcase and drab window coverings. There’s no one in the room and no place to hide although there is a door on the back wall. Were your eyes playing tricks on you?! Not possible - how would the door have opened? The only thing that could be considered evidence of anyone having been in the room recently is a pungent smell… and judging by that smell maybe you are better off not having met the room’s inhabitant.

Of possible interest though are the small bookcase and a door in the back wall which you assume leads outside. What should you do next?
