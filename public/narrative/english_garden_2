You step back onto the broad green lawn of the English Garden bordered by drifts of flowers, grasses, and herbs. The events of the potting shed already seem distant.

At the northern end of the garden is an archway leading through the high walls to a small orchard. At the southern end of the garden is an archway leading to the formal parterre garden.
