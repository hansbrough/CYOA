To your surprise Mr. Cuttingsworth looked taken aback. For someone who normally seemed unaware of others altogether, his loss of composure struck you as odd. He avoided eye contact and stammered something unintelligible which you took to be equivalent to a “no”. It was frankly hard to tell sometimes with Mr. Cuttingsworth what he was saying or what his intentions were. As he began speaking again you noticed movement at the far end of the greenhouse and interrupted him “Oh, I see you have a friend helping you.”  Then faintly you think you hear your name called from the far end of the building. Mr. Cuttingsworth looks momentarily nonplussed but says yes he does have an assistant today. Something doesn’t feel right but does it really matter?
