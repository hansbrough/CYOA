Stepping inside, you’re met with the familiar hum of industrial refrigerators and the clatter of dishes stacked in a drying rack.

The kitchen feels both functional and slightly worn, its long metal tables scarred with years of chopping and meal prep. Several refrigerators line the back wall, mismatched, some newer than others—evidence of years of ad-hoc upgrades.

This kitchen is one of the club’s most frequently used spaces, rented out for weddings, luncheons, and fundraisers. On a busy night, it must be alive with voices, cooks working in tandem.

Tonight, though, it’s quieter.

Your attention drifts to the notices pinned to the far wall, a chaotic mix of government health regulations, items for sale, and lost pet flyers.

So many lost pets.

More than you’d expect.

One in particular stands out—a printed flyer for Mrs. Aster’s missing miniature goldendoodle, Marigold. The picture shows a tiny, curly-haired dog with a lopsided bow around its neck.

You remember how much Mrs. Aster adored that dog—she must have been devastated.

You skim the other flyers. More dogs. More cats. Some of them dated weeks ago.

Was it just coincidence? Or was something else happening?

Your thoughts drift—if so many pets have gone missing, maybe someone here has seen Rosemary.

You turn, scanning the room again. Who should you ask?
