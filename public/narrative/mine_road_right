You hear the faint rumbling of machinery and perhaps even the sound of indistinct voices. At this point getting out of the dark is your main objective so hearing those sounds is the deciding factor in which way to go. The first thing you notice is the myriad of bioluminescent fungi growing in the corners of the passageway. The colors and elegant shapes remind you of jellyfish displays at a large, public aquarium. It’s too bad they are hidden down here and not on display. You suppose their hidden nature and scarcity only helps to enhance their beauty - at least in the eye of this beholder. As you continue walking the occasional noises grow louder and the faint smell of burning brakes grows more noticeable.

Eventually you come to bend in the mineshaft and around the corner comes the unmistakable whiteness of artificial light. Peeking carefully around the bend you see what can only be an empty loading dock at the top of which looks to be an entryway and the source of the light. Through the entry are greenish shapes that look to be plants. You wait several minutes but there doesn't seem to be anyone around. Moving quickly you make your way up the dock, toward the light and through the entry which is covered in thick translucent strips of plastic. Upon entering the room you duck quickly behind a table and notice immediately the change in humidity, smell and temperature. All of this tells you that you’ve just entered a greenhouse! Crouching for several minutes more it seems the room is empty except for the sound of the occasional automated mister watering plants. You peek over the table and see an immense room of bizarre looking tropical plants. Does this somehow belong to the Garden Club? It must have cost a lot of money and you're sure it would be the type of thing the club would brag about in order to attract new members.

On your right, you notice, is a service elevator. You want to look at the plants but you also just want to get back to something you recognize.
