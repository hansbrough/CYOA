You approach the cottage and step around the broken gate. A moment later a chemical wave of adrenaline washes through your system as you see in shadows of the window a face looking back. At least you think it looks like a face - but it’s not moving. Then the eyes on the face blink. Yes - this is really happening! Unfortunately you are frozen in some combination of indecision and fear. The face disappears from the cottage window and a moment later you hear the scrape of  what must be the front door’s latch; the door swings open. Is this an offer to enter? Should you enter? This is all well outside your comfort zone.
