You say to the exasperating Dr. Loam “how was your day Dr.” A few seconds later he says “mmm hmm, very” after considering what he could mean you say “Very what Dr., “tiresome” or “exciting” or “scary” or just a drag” he stumbles on his words for a moment and says “B final answer” then you attempt to walk away he says “I seen some scary things in my day but not as scary as today, watch out for yerr self kiddo something is wrong”.
