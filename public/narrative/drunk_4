Dr. Loam leans heavily on the bar, his fingers drumming idly against the rim of his glass. His bravado from earlier seems to have thinned, leaving behind something quieter, more restless.

You hesitate, then ask, “How’s your night, Dr. Loam?”

He blinks, like he’s just remembered you’re still here. His laugh is soft, humorless. “Ah, the student returns.” He swirls his drink, watching the liquid move before letting out a long breath. “Tell me something. You ever wish you could take something back?”

The question feels out of place, like stepping off a familiar path into unknown woods.

You frown. “Like what?”

Loam doesn’t answer right away. He just shakes his head. “Ahh, doesn’t matter. Not like anyone listens to me anymore.” His voice drops lower, so that only you can hear. “Not like I could stop it anyway.”

A beat of silence.

Then, barely above a whisper, he mutters:

“They’re still hungry, you know.”

The words land like a stone in your stomach.

You hesitate. “Who’s hungry?”

His fingers tighten around his glass, jaw clenching like he’s already said too much. His gaze flicks to something behind you—someone, perhaps. Then, just as quickly, he forces a chuckle, his voice louder now, almost too casual. “Doesn’t matter! We all have to live with our mistakes, don’t we?”

He claps you on the shoulder—a little too hard. “Enjoy the fundraiser, kid.”

With that, he turns away, signaling for another drink.
