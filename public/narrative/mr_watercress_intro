The mystery guest seems disappointed but follows you across the room to meet the club Treasurer, Mr. Watercress. The Treasurer was a frenetic older gentleman who never seemed to run out of energy and more often than not had a hand in every Club endeavor. Speaking with Mr. Watercress was always a challenge as conversations invariably turned into a monologue. Getting a word in was difficult and it was never clear if his mind paused long enough to parse what others were saying. Even with that fault he still managed a certain charisma and was tolerable in small doses.

When he sees you approaching with the mystery guest his face goes a little pale. Without pausing for an introduction the mystery guest says to him “Since we last met you have authored your own fate.” Mr. Watercress looked at her quizzically “I’m sure I don’t understand. We have never met.” Without responding to his protest she continued “We each have a past that includes our every action, every thought, and every decision that has impacted our journey and brought us to the present moment.”. Inexplicably she then turns and walks away into the crowd.
