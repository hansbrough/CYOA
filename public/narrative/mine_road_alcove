Walking past the ramp a few hundred feet you reach the end of the mineshaft road and see mounds of rock rubble pushed along the walls and into corners apparently left over from the original excavation. Growing atop the rubble are larger amounts of bioluminescent fungi than youâ€™ve seen previously which makes it easier to see details of the alcove. You notice a natural break along the walls which looks just big enough to be usable as a passageway. Inside the passageway are more fungi which provide enough light that you can see the outlines of a rudimentary door. This is feeling a little creepy now - especially when you remember that you are alone, underground, unarmed, in the dark. Looking at that door you start to have second thoughts about going any further. I mean really - why are you down here again?!
