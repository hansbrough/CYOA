The club’s makeshift bar is little more than a folding table stocked with a few basic drink options, manned by a young bartender who looks like he’d rather be anywhere else. He leans lazily against the table, idly toying with a bottle opener, his posture exuding the kind of casual disinterest that only comes from being roped into helping by a relative—which, in his case, you now know is his aunt, Mrs. Greene.

He glances up as you approach.

“What can I get you?”

It’s a polite enough greeting, but his tone is flat, and his expression remains bored—like he’s already predicting you’ll order something unremarkable and that your interaction will be over in seconds.

But tonight, you’re not here just for a drink. You need something from him.
