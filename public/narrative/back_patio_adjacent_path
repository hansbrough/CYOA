The winding path runs next to a small seasonal creek which at this time of year is still running fairly strong. The sound of the creek muffles other sounds making it hard to hear clearly. You continue on the path down a small hill hoping you can get into a better position for a bit of eavesdropping. Unfortunately the path seems to be heading off in the wrong direction as it veers around corners and through dense patches of a reed-like plant. “Oh!” you exclaim. “This looks like it could be Peacock Reed!” You remember that it’s a native plant with very limited range which is unusual for… but your thoughts are cut short as you’re startled by short and shrill, flute-like bursts of sound. The reeds closest to you have been forced open at their tops by escaping gas to reveal brightly colored interior walls. The effect of several plants all going off at once was certainly enough to make an impression which as you remember from one of the Garden Club lectures is entirely the point. Peacock Reed, also known as Magnaavem calamuseae, developed this unusual behavior as a defense strategy against foraging herbivores. Apparently the local deer find it particularly delicious. Well you certainly pose no threat to the plants but it’s very likely they may have given you away to anyone nearby.

After unavoidably triggering several more of the irksome plants you eventually reach a fork in the path. In one direction you head back toward the creek and you suppose back toward the voices and in the other direction the path veers off into a forested area.
