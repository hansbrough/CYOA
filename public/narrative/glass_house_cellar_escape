Realizing you're trapped in a small room with only one way out you decide it’s now or never. You’ve got to rush up the stairs and burst past whomever might be up there. At least the element of surprise will be on your side and you hope that’s enough. You can hear the voices echoing down the steps. Adrenaline pumping your sprint up the steps with your best war face and the closest thing you can muster to a battle yell. At the top, almost in single file, you see three men with startled looks. The first instinctively steps to the side; the second reaches for you but misses, but unfortunately the third manages to tackle you around the waist and throw you to the ground. The first two (who you recognize as full time employees of the Garden Club) quickly recover their wits and help to hold you down. The third, who you recognize now as Mr. Cuttingsworth, stands up, straightens his shirt and frowns. “Young lady - ” he began, “ you have made a most unfortunate decision. Tell me - what did you see down in the cellar?” Still recovering from a full body tackle by someone nearly twice your weight you manage to stammer “Nothing. I mean I saw a door with light coming from behind.” Mr. Cuttingsworth sighs and looks at the ground for a long time before responding “We cannot let her go. Put her in the storage room until I find out what to do.”
