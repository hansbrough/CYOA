You are in a long room with many tables atop which sit hundreds if not thousands of plants. Suspended from the ceiling are lights, cords and hoses. This looks like an industrial grade grow house - but underground. You’ve often thought about buying a little grow tent for your apartment but never made the leap mainly because of the expense. This setup dwarfs anything you could have imagined. Overhead several sets of lights begin to move between tables pulled by what looks like a chain driven system. Most everything looks automated.

As you walk between the tables to look at the plants you can see they have been organized by growth stages: seedlings, young plants, larger specimen plants etc. It’s all very slick and impressive not to mention the plants themselves look very healthy. Even though you are not as expert as many of the club members when it comes to identifying plants you still know quite a few species on sight. So it’s somewhat frustrating that not a single one of these plants looks familiar! Many look exotic - possibly from tropical regions of the world - there are definitely a few carnivorous plants. Some of the plants have hand-written labels with dates.

At your current location the plants are tall enough that they rise above your head. One fruiting specimen in particular catches your attention. It smells very similar to delicious fresh baked bread and the fruit looks vaguely similar to bread rolls. The largest plants are boxed in the type of wooden containers you might expect to see at a tree nursery. Understandably someone has placed a barrier of caution tape in front of a plant in the corner which can be nothing other than a giant carnivorous “Pitcher Plant” whose trap is larger than the size of a 50 gal drum. The semi-transparent walls of the drum reveal the shadowy form of something four-legged. You shudder involuntarily at the thought of what poor creature must have met its fate in there. Of course it’s not like animals are meandering around down here and falling into pitcher plants, someone must have fed it to the plant… that thought is not reassuring either.

As you wander down the room into the smaller sized plants, your instant favorite is the “Cup and Saucer” plant which has a stiff waxy flower in the shape of a mini tea cup. Inside many of the teacup flowers were pools of sticky nectar. Adorable! And you can personally attest - quite tasty. Another favorite are a group of young trees about shoulder height with luminescent, papersack-like ‘fruit’. Appropriately they were labeled “Lantern Trees”. Many other plants have various forms of thick muscle-like bases with blunt appendages. Some have trunks atop the base, others have several snake-like arms and still others porcupine-like spines. This group of plants are the most alien of species as they were utterly unlike anything you’ve seen previously.

At the end of the room close to where you are standing a wooden door suddenly opens and three men enter carrying bundles of plant cuttings. Browsing the plants and lost in thought you are caught by surprise; there is no time to hide. You turn to run thinking you might be able to lose them but they are already just a few feet away. Soon you are tackled to the ground and held firmly. One of them says “You have made a grave error in judgement, young lady.” It’s Mr. Cuttingsworth. “Take her to the storage closet until I find out what to do.” he says.
