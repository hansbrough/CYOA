Over the years your life took on a meaning that burned with a fierceness few could understand and that you never expected. As time passed you helped to expand the sanctum for crypto-botanicals and legitimize the field of cryptobotany. As older members, including Mr. Watercress, eventually passed away, you kept a promise to preserve what represented their lifetimeâ€™s work. You even found a young scientist to mentor for what is a collection without a curator. There were times when you were forced to commit admittedly unpleasant acts but they were always justified by the ends.

**The End.**
