Scanning the main hall, your eyes sweep over clusters of club members engaged in quiet conversation, the occasional burst of laughter rising above the steady hum of voices. You’re about to turn away when a familiar figure catches your attention.

Mr. Watercress stands near a side table covered in old botanical journals, gesturing animatedly as he speaks to a group of listeners—though, from their expressions, it’s clear they lost the thread of his monologue some time ago.

The club’s Treasurer, Mr. Watercress is an older man with boundless energy, always involved in every committee, every project, every decision. He talks quickly—too quickly—his words tumbling over each other, filling every silence before anyone else can. Speaking with him is less a conversation and more an endurance test.

You hesitate. Is this a mistake?

Then you remember Mrs. Aster’s words. Rosemary had spoken to him earlier.

You take a deep breath and step forward.

"Mr. Watercress?"

His rapid-fire monologue cuts off abruptly, his gaze snapping to you. For the briefest moment, his expression flickers—something unreadable passes behind his eyes. Then, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone, replaced with his usual cheerful intensity.

"Ah! Always good to see young minds taking an interest—I was just discussing something truly fascinating!"
