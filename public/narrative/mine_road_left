Where the floors meet the walls is growing a fungus with which you are not familiar with but it is hard to miss as it is the source of light. These bioluminescent fungi seemed to thrive here in the damp and dark environment. There were several sizes, shapes, colors and varieties which taken together were nothing short of mesmerizing. They qualified as a garden in your mind. In addition they were incredibly practical! You couldnâ€™t read a newspaper by their light but you could certainly walk down the passage with the confidence of knowing you were not going to step off a cliff or run into a wall.

Walking for what seems a long time you eventually come to a split in the mine shaft. On the left a ramp wide enough for a vehicle heads steeply toward the surface. On the right the mine shaft road continues at a roughly even level but ends within a dozen yards in an alcove.
