The elevator is little more than a cage of thick gauge wire in an open shaft. The controls are simple - up and down. It’s risky to take this elevator up because you have no idea if someone might just be there when you arrive but it sounds quiet enough. You decide to take the risk and push the ‘up’ button. There is a mechanical sound of gears engaging and the soft humm of an electric motor. A few seconds later the floor of the glass house comes into view along with natural light. The elevator comes to a halt with a quiet “Click” and the wire door slides open. You are relieved that no one is in sight. Directly in front of you is an almost ceiling high, screen of broad leaf tropical plants which obscure your view. From nearby the tunes of an old instrumental piece play; hopefully the melody covered any sounds made by your trip in the elevator.
