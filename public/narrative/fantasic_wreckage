You half-expect Ms. Greene to brush off your challenge with a condescending remark, but instead, she steps forward, eyes alight with the thrill of a fight. "Oh? You want to do this?" she says, her voice carrying just enough amusement to feel like a slap in the face.

The heat in your chest spikes—you don’t even remember picking up your drink until you see it splash across her face. Gasps ripple through the crowd. Ms. Greene stands there for a second, expression unreadable, liquid dripping from her chin.

Then she wipes her face with slow, deliberate movements, straightens her posture, and tears into you.

"You immature little brat," she snarls, her voice razor-sharp. "You think you can just flounce in here, take whatever you want, and stomp your feet when someone calls you out? This club has standards, young lady. Standards you clearly don’t meet."

The words sting, but it’s the way the crowd hangs onto them, eyes flicking to you in judgment, that makes something inside you snap.

Before you realize what you’re doing, your hands grab her lapels—a sudden, desperate impulse to shut her up, to shake her, to make her listen to you for once.

Ms. Greene stumbles back. A murmur spreads through the onlookers like a rising tide.

Then she falls.

It isn’t dramatic. She doesn’t crumple like a felled villain, just lands hard on her side, more stunned than hurt. But that doesn’t matter.

Because to the watching crowd, to the dozens of staring eyes, it looks like you pushed her.

A hand clasps your arm—Mr. Shovelton, the club’s Sergeant-at-Arms. "That’s quite enough," he says, voice even but firm. "I think you should leave."

There’s no arguing. Not now. Not with the room against you.

You barely remember walking out. The club doors closing behind you feel heavier than they should.

Days Later…

A letter arrives. You already know what it says before you open it.

"Following a formal review, we regret to inform you that your behavior at the Spring Fundraiser was deemed inappropriate. A motion for termination of your membership has been passed unanimously."

You stare at the words, numb.

There’s no way back.

Your time with the Garden Club is over.

The End.
