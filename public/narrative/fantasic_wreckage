Never one to back down, and especially in front of others, Ms Greene takes you up on your offer and follows you to a corner of the Main Hall. Your temper is flaring, you feel a bit out of control and as if from a distance you watch as your drink is splashed in Ms Greene’s face. She steps closer, wipes her face and in her deep voice she loudly berates you as a selfish, immature twit. As a crowd gathers you reach for the lapels of her suit jacket and shake her in a rage that you didn’t know was inside. At this point Ms Greene who is several years older than yourself falls to the ground amid sounds of alarm from the growing audience. “Oh no..” you think “What have I done?!” It all happened so fast and doesn’t seem real. Several members bend to help Ms Greene as you slowly back away amid stares of disbelief and disapproval. Mr. Shovelton the Sgt at Arms approaches and escorts you to the front door suggesting that you go home and regain control of your senses.

Several days later a letter arrives from the club requesting that you not return and that a motion has been made and approved for the termination of your membership. In shame you put the letter down and realize your days as a Garden Club member have come to an ignominious end.

The End.
