You catch up to Mrs. Aster just as she reaches a quiet corner of the patio. She’s standing by the garden’s stone railing, hands gripping the edge as if steadying herself. For a long moment, she doesn’t acknowledge you, staring into the hedges beyond.

"Mrs. Aster," you say gently. "I don’t mean to intrude, but… what just happened back there? Are you all right?"

She exhales sharply through her nose, shaking her head. "It’s nothing, dear. Nothing I should be saying."

You hesitate, unsure if pushing further is the right move. But then you see it—the way her hands tremble ever so slightly, how her shoulders tense at the mere thought of whatever just transpired.

"Is this about Marigold?" you ask carefully.

Her head snaps toward you, her usually soft expression darkening. "That man—Mr. Watercress. He thinks he owns this place. Thinks he can do as he pleases, change things that don’t need changing. But I know what I saw. And I know Marigold didn’t just run off. She never would."

She grips your arm suddenly, eyes wide, urgent. "They were out there late one night, by the greenhouse. A delivery truck came, unmarked but big. I saw crates being unloaded—large ones. Heavy enough that it took two men to move each one. They weren’t plants for the club’s usual garden sales, I can tell you that."

A chill runs down your spine. "Did you see what was in them?"

She shakes her head. "No, but I saw labels. Foreign script, and a logo with a snake wrapped around a flower. Some of the boxes had ‘LIVE GOODS’ stamped on them. And Mr. Watercress was there, signing for it all. And now they say my Marigold is ‘just lost’?" Her voice wavers. "I don’t believe it. Something’s not right. And they think I’m just some foolish old woman who won’t ask questions."

She exhales, her grip on your arm loosening. "I just want my Marigold back. And I want this club to be what it’s always been. Not… whatever they’re turning it into."

You nod slowly, unsure of what to say. But one thing is clear: Mrs. Aster has seen something she wasn’t supposed to. And whatever is happening here—it’s not just about missing pets anymore.
