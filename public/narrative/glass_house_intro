Around a bend in the utility road a large greenhouse comes into view. This doesn’t look like just any greenhouse though … it’s ornate glass work and dark metal structure give it a distinctly Victorian feel. A skirting of rough hewn sandstone block runs along the perimeter of the building which appears to be a few hundred feet in length. Columns made of the same sandstone hold the massive glass roof. Atop the roof sit several glass domes. Through the side of the building you can make out the arching leaves of large tropical plants.

The overall effect is dramatic and you feel yourself drawn to explore but notice a wrought iron fence with a hand painted sign that reads “Private. Not open to the public.”. It’s odd that you have never heard anyone in the club mention this place.
