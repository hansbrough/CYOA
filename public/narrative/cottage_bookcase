The inside of the cottage is almost monastic in appearance with no attempt at anything resembling decoration or frivolity which makes the bookcase the most unusual item in the room. The bookcase's plain but sturdy frame certainly wouldn’t be considered unusual in any other place but here in the cottage it was the single item that seemed to have any character at all. The books were mostly botanical with titles such as “Merriweather’s Visual Encyclopedia of Tropical Plants”, “A Guide to Cottage Gardens” and “History of Medicinal Plants”. By far the most unusual feature of the bookcase was it’s glass door which unfortunately was locked. Now your curiosity is piqued. Why would there be a bookcase out here in the woods and why would it be locked? This is an unusual situation.
