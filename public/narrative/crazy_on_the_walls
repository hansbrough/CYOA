Because of the low light It’s hard to see much of the walls but you can see candles on the floor and a book of matches. Lighting a candle you hold it close to the wall. Between crossed out scribbling of watercress’ name there are blocks of text that appear to have been written at different times in different media. The letters are poorly formed and hard to read and while you recognize individual words the sentences they form seem nonsensical. It does seem that some of the text is autobiographical and mentions donations to the Garden Club itself. “Oh. this is interesting…” you think. A mention of the Hollyhock family. A boy. Lots of memories written. His lost family. Sadness. Betrayal. Your attention is nightmarishly torn from the text by the sound of breathing in the room. You turn, candle in hand to see a dirty face just feet from your own. Yellow teeth are visible in its glare. “Watercresssss...” a voice hisses. You feel something heavy hit the side of your head, lose control of your legs and crumple to the ground. There is darkness again. The End
