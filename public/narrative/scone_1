You arrive at the dessert table and discover several plates of lovely scones. Not surprisingly Ms. Greene, the self appointed matron of the club, is explaining her new recipe to a polite but disinterested club member whom you don’t recognize (or perhaps they are a guest?)
Ms. Greene makes a point of speaking in a manner that is meant to let you know she is an “authority”. She serves on the Club’s board and possibly as a result has strong opinions about club procedure and member behavior. You’ve learned to steer clear of Ms Greene as nothing good ever seems to have come out of a conversation with her. Still, the somewhat ghoulish temptation to “poke the beast” is always lingering just below the surface.
