The dessert table is exactly as you expected—neatly arranged plates of golden scones, still warm enough to carry the faintest scent of butter and apricot. You pause, contemplating a strategic grab, but of course, nothing at the Garden Club is ever that simple.

Ms. Greene, the self-appointed matron of all things proper, holds court beside the table, extolling the virtues of her latest scone recipe to an unfortunate club member trapped in polite obligation. You don’t recognize them—possibly a guest, or just someone adept at avoiding attention, which you could admire under different circumstances.

Ms. Greene, however, is impossible to ignore. She has a way of speaking that isn't just informative, but declarative, as if she is handing down club law rather than discussing baked goods. She is, after all, on the board, and she wields that fact like a well-polished garden spade—useful for pruning the club’s social landscape into the shape she prefers.

Over the past year, you've developed a functional strategy: avoid Ms. Greene at all costs. Nothing good has ever come from a conversation with her. Still, as you hover at the edge of the table, that ever-present, mildly self-destructive temptation flickers at the edges of your thoughts. Poke the beast? Or, more wisely, slip away before she notices you?
