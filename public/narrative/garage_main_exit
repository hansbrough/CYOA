Pressing a large black button on the control panel starts a motor overhead and the garage door begins to roll up with a loud “Chunk!, Chunk!, Chunk!”. A breeze of fresh Spring air hits you face. It feels nice; you’d forgotten how it is to be out of doors - as opposed to a dark mineshaft.

A few yards away is a trail running perpendicular to the garage. Once you reach the trail you can see in the distance a small valley and the Garden Club’s large Victorian style greenhouse. It’s surprising just how you seemed to have popped up in the middle of nowhere. From close by you hear the unmistakable humm of an electric motor and tires traveling over the dirt and rock path. Directly in front of you one of the small utility vehicles pulls up with Mr. Watercress and two men dressed in work clothes bearing the Garden Hall insignia. He looks from you to the open garage then a moment later offers a friendly wave. “Hello!” he says. ”The boys and I were just out doing some maintenance.” As if to prove this he points as some shovels in the back of the vehicle. “I tell you what boys…” he continues - now talking to the work crew “How about you head back and leave me here. It’s a nice day for a walk.” He turns to you and says “What do you say? Shall we walk back to the Garden Hall and try to catch the last of the events?” You nod hesitantly, suddenly feeling a bit vulnerable out here by yourself. With your acquiescence the two men leave, driving through the open garage door which slowly rolls down into place behind them.
