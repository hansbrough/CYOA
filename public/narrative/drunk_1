You see Dr. Loam talking to his friends in the corner. You try to avoid eye contact with him, But to no avail as he sees you looking and walks over saying  “Hello!”. His words are a little slurred so you can tell he is already drunk and his breath reeks of scotch. He mutters under his breath to no one in particular “another one on the rocks please.”
