As you make your way to the bar, you hear an unmistakable voice rising over the hum of conversation. Dr. Loam is holding court in the corner, a small circle of older members nodding politely as he waves a half-empty glass in the air. His voice is rich but carries the telltale slur of someone well into his evening.

“Ah, the golden days,” he sighs, shaking his head. “Back when this place still meant something. When we were doing real work, not—” He gestures vaguely at the fundraiser banner.

One of the members, a woman with tightly curled silver hair, chuckles nervously. “Now, now, Dr. Loam, we still do important work.”

He snorts into his drink. “Sure we do.”

You try to slip past unnoticed, but his eyes catch yours, and a wide grin spreads across his face. “Ah! A student of science among us! A fresh mind!” He staggers toward you, resting a heavy hand on your shoulder before you can dodge.

“Dr. Loam,” you say politely.

He raises his glass in mock salute. “You ever read my work? No? Ah, well. That’s the way of things, isn’t it? One day, you’re a pioneer, the next…” He swirls his drink, watching the liquid spin before tossing it back. “People forget.”

You catch a glimpse of something behind the boozy bravado—something deeper, a bitterness that isn’t just from the scotch.

Before you can respond, he waves down the bartender. “Another one on the rocks, my good man. And—” he turns back to you, winking—“whatever the young scholar is having.”
