From the back of the kitchen a door leads to a small covered porch and set of wooden stairs which lead down to the few parking spots located at the back of the Garden Hall. This very utilitarian area is mainly used for delivery of supplies and trash collection. Sitting at the bottom of the stairs is the young bartender who is apparently on a cigarette break. You yell down at him “Have you seen an older lady out here?” He turns slowly, looks you over and responds “Why? lost yours? I know where you find about a hundred more.” His unhelpful response irritates you and it must show on your face as he quickly follows up with “If you’re looking for Mrs Aster she was out here earlier but I didn’t pay attention to where she went.” At this point it occurs to you that maybe she went to the back patio but that seems like a big maybe.
