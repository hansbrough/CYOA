Crossing the short distance to Mr. Cuttingsworth you emerge from behind a plant, perhaps a bit suddenly, and interrupt the conversation, perhaps a bit loudly, with a “Hi there!” as if you had just met a friend on the street. Marching across his face you can see in order: startlement, confusion and irritation. “Young lady you do not belong here. Please leave.” The nature of his response was unmistakably rude and condescending so your response was similarly spoken “Mr. Cuttingsworth this is club property. I pay my dues. I have just as much right to be today here as you do.” Before responding he nodded subtly to the hired hand “Ma’am I suggest you take a closer look at your copy of the by-laws” Next a firm hand clasps you above your elbow, you are escorted to one of the golf cart-like utility vehicles and driven to the back of the Main Hall.
