The scone sits heavy in your stomach.

That was… unnecessary.

You didn’t gain anything by standing your ground against Ms. Greene except maybe a minor rush of adrenaline. But as the moment fades, you realize it was more about proving something to yourself than to her.

Your gaze drifts across the room, catching sight of Mrs. Aster wobbling under the weight of a box of dishes as she disappears into the kitchen.

Mrs. Aster.

Unlike Ms. Greene, the older woman had always been kind, always carried warmth in her words. She didn’t care about club hierarchy or long-standing grudges. She just wanted to be helpful in whatever way she still could.

Maybe that’s the kind of presence you should be spending your time with right now.
