In hindsight your actions were impulsive. With not a small amount of relief you're glad you didn't let the situation get out of control - or rather let yourself get out of control. Sometimes public confrontations can be embarrassing.

You notice Mrs. Aster teetering into the Garden Club’s kitchen with a box of dishes. Mrs. Aster was one of a group who made up long time members mostly in their 80’s and 90’s. To them the club was more of a chance to socialize with old friends than it was to get their hands dirty in the garden. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to but humans are mechanical things and age takes its due. Simple things like working on your hands and knees or even bending over become difficult. Mrs. Aster had struck you from the beginning as a kind soul who took joy in helping how she still could, which these days was mostly preparing the Club’s monthly luncheons.

Feeling inspired to be a good samaritan after your near blow up with Ms Greene you head into the kitchen to offer a hand. “Hello Mrs. Aster can I help you with those?” you ask in your sweetest voice. “Oh thank you dear.” she replies. You're not sure she knows who you are or your name but that’s ok. “How have you been Mrs Astor?” you ask mostly because you’re not sure what to say. “Oh, fine I suppose but it’s been hard since my little Marigold disappeared.” She pointed to a section of the kitchen wall covered in notices ranging from heath and minimum wage government posters to items for sale to lost items and pets. The last category seemed to have ballooned out of proportion lately. Trying to sound encouraging, you reply “Oh, I’m sure she will turn up. She probably just went on a little adventure.” This didn’t seem to help as Mrs Astor went quiet for a moment before looking up and saying “No dear, she didn't like adventures.” not knowing what to say you offer a bit lamely “No. I’m sure she doesn’t. That was just - I was just trying to be funny.”
