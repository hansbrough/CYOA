You casually approach the door to the club office, glancing around to make sure no one is paying attention. The handle, unsurprisingly, is locked. No signs of forced entry, no telltale gaps in the doorframe that might suggest it’s been broken into—just a sturdy, old-fashioned lock keeping it shut. You weren’t expecting it to swing open, but still, you can’t help but feel mildly disappointed.

Peering through the small window in the door, you can make out a well-kept but unremarkable office space. A neatly arranged desk, a few filing cabinets, and the soft glow of a desk lamp left on. It casts just enough light to reveal a single sheet of paper resting near the lamp’s edge, as if someone set it down in a hurry and never returned.

Even from here, you can just barely make out the heading:

"Donor Acquisition & Special Procurement – Fiscal Report"

Your breath catches slightly. Special Procurement? That’s not exactly the kind of phrase you expect to see in a garden club’s financial documents. You frown, trying to parse what it might mean. A list of new suppliers? A record of special purchases? The wording is just vague enough to feel suspicious.

You lean in, squinting, trying to make out anything more, but the angle is all wrong. Whatever secrets the document holds, they’ll stay locked away in that office—unless, of course, you find a way inside.

With that thought, an idea begins to form.

Mrs. Greene, the club’s secretary, is the only one with the key, and let’s be honest—getting anything out of her would be like trying to pry open an old rusted lock with a toothpick. But her nephew—the bartender—might be another story.

You step back from the door, casually dusting off your hands as if you were never there in the first place. Now you just need to figure out how to convince him.
