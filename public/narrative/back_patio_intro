You'd always liked the Garden Hall’s back patio. Many years before you joined the Garden Club, a lot of time and money must have been spent creating this private space. To be honest it was a big reason why you gave into Rosemary’s request to join. The patio always brought you a sense of ease with its generous spaces and adjoining paths that left the impression there was something unexplored just around the corner. The patio was just a small part of the Garden Hall’s land and you had never fully explored all the paths. Several hectares had been donated years ago by a patron whose family had owned the land since the late 18th century. Rosemary had mentioned that these rolling hills had once been coal country but had been abandoned generations ago after the deposits eventually proved unfruitful.

Standing on the patio with your back to the hall and staring into the garden you notice a path that is either new or you’ve somehow overlooked it in the past. Coming from the same direction are muffled voices. One of the voices suddenly turns into an angry shout.
