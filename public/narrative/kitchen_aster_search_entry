Armed now with a small mission you feel better about your time at the club this afternoon. Entering you see the familiar long metal tables used for preparing and assembling meals. An assortment of potluck style, homemade dishes and a few items ordered from local restaurants are laid out neatly along the tables. This seems like a task Mrs Astor could have been working on earlier in the afternoon.

On one of the walls hang the usual government notices about health and safety along with hand made notices about items for sale or lost items. You see several notices regarding lost pets showing little dog and cat faces in various poses. Coincidentally one of the lost dogs is Mrs Aster’s miniature goldendoodle named “Marigold”. You think how much the loss of her dog must have upset her. It is possible she could have gone searching for her dog?
