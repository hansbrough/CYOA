Being a bit of a plant collector you carry a small set of secateurs and bags for just such a situation. The key to collection is to take only what’s needed and never enough to harm the parent plant. With that in mind you find a larger specimen that looks like it could spare a few “fingers” and deftly remove enough material for your propagation needs. To your surprise several of the scaly, snake-like plant “fingers” orient themselves in your direction, rear back and make a striking movement. Luckily they did not actually make contact. You are close enough to see small terminal spines on the tip of each of the Medusa plant’s appendages and can only imagine what the results might have been. As you back away many of the plants seem to grow agitated and rub their scaly arms together making a distinct warning noise. Some plants you remember are best left alone.
