You step away from the kitchen and enter the main seating area. The room has thinned out as the evening progresses, but a few older members remain, engaged in quiet conversations.

In a cozy corner, you notice Mrs. Mavis Aster seated across from another elderly woman you don't recognize. Their heads are close together, voices low.

As you approach, you overhear the unfamiliar woman say, "It's not like it used to be, Mavis. Things are changing, and not for the better."

Mrs. Aster sighs, replying, "I know, but what can we do? It's not our place anymore."

Sensing your presence, Mrs. Aster looks up and offers a gentle smile. "Oh, hello, dear. Is everything alright?"

You return the smile. "Good evening, Mrs. Aster. I was wondering if you've seen Rosemary tonight? I expected to see her around but haven't come across her."

Mrs. Aster's expression shifts slightly, a hint of concern in her eyes. "Rosemary? Yes, I believe I saw her earlier." She pauses, glancing at her companion before continuing, "She was speaking with Mr. Watercress, if I recall correctly."

"Do you remember where they were?" you ask.

Mrs. Aster furrows her brow, thinking. "Perhaps in the gardens or near the potting shed. I'm sorry, my mind isn't as sharp as it once was."

The other woman touches Mrs. Aster's arm gently. "Mavis, maybe it's best not to dwell on it."

Mrs. Aster nods, then looks back at you with a faint smile. "Do be careful, dear. Things aren't always as they seem."

With that, the two women return to their conversation, leaving you with more questions than answers. If Rosemary was speaking with Mr. Watercress, what could it have been about?
