Your heart is working so hard you’re sure anyone coming down those steps is bound to hear the pounding in your chest. The voices are close now. You can hear them echoing from the top of the stairs and then footsteps as they make their way closer. Luckily for you their eyes must not have adjusted for the change in light yet and they head straight for the locked wooden door. From their silhouettes you can make out the three figures as Mr Cuttingsworth and two of the full time Garden Club employees. One of the hired hands checks the door and says “The door’s still locked Mr. Cuttingsworth”. “Good.” says Cuttingsworth “We do not want anyone in there. No one needs to see what’s behind that door. It’s none of their business. But if they are not in there and didn't come out...” He turns suddenly and yells “There in the shadows! Grab them!” Before you can reach the stairs two pairs of strong hands have you firmly held, face down, on the ground. You struggle but it’s no use. “Hold her still!” says Mr. Cuttingsworth. “You're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, young lady. I assure you it’s nothing personal.” With those words you feel a sharp pain on the side of your neck. Your vision goes blurry and you lose consciousness.

**The End.**
