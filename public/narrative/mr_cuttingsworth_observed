You nearly miss him at first—not because he isn’t there, but because he seems to occupy the space just outside of notice.

While the rest of the club members exchange pleasantries and polite laughter, Mr. Cuttingsworth stands alone near the room’s perimeter, half in the shadows of a tall display case, half watching the crowd. His posture is still, almost unnatural, like a gardener who has been standing in the same position for hours, studying a particularly stubborn plant.

The moment you look at him, you feel his eyes shift to you—sharp, assessing, clinical. He doesn’t smile. He doesn’t greet you. He simply observes, in the way one might observe a sapling struggling in poor soil.

And then, just as quickly, he looks away, turning his attention back to the room’s chatter as if you were never there.

It would be easy to dismiss this as nothing, except… something about his presence sticks with you. While everyone else in the hall is performing—laughing, gossiping, making small talk—Cuttingsworth alone seems completely unaffected by it all. Not engaged. Not detached. Just… waiting.

Waiting for what?

A moment passes, and then you move on, filing this away in the back of your mind.
