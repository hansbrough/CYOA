The wooden stairs led from the back of the Garden Hall’s garbage and utility area to the kitchen’s back door. Entering you see the familiar long metal tables used for preparing and assembling meals. The Kitchen has accumulated a few refrigerators over the years as well. From time to time the Hall is rented for weddings or other events to generate extra income for the club. This kitchen was one of the main selling points. On one of the walls hang the usual government notices about health and safety along with hand made notices about items for sale or lost items. You see several notices regarding lost pets showing little dog and cat faces in various poses - so sad.
