Yelling obscenities as he runs up the remainder of the hill the bartender is clearly enraged. Mr. Watercress stands in place holding a dangling dog leash in one hand watching the approaching menace. The distance is closing fast and you expect nothing less than a full body tackle. Instead Mr. Watercress steps to the side, pulls from behind his back what looks like a cricket bat and smacks the bartender as he charges. Still in a run the bartender loses his balance after being hit, stumbles and rolls down the same hill as the dog.

With a sharp intake of breath you quietly exclaim “What a shame. I was just starting to like the guy.” Clearly whatever is happening here at Garden Hall will remain a mystery as far as you are concerned. The violence, the secrecy, the mutant plants it’s all more than you care to be a part of. It’s better to leave and forget this place. Next year when Rosemary pressures you into attending the fund raiser you won’t have a problem saying “Thanks - but no Thanks”

**The End.**
