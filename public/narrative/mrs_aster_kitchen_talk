The kitchen is quieter than the main hall, filled with the soft sounds of running water and the occasional clink of dishes. You roll up your sleeves and take a drying towel from the counter. Mrs. Aster smiles as you join her at the sink.

"Thank you, dear. My hands aren’t what they used to be. Too many years of gardening, I suppose," she says with a small chuckle.

As you rinse a plate, your eyes drift to the bulletin board on the far wall. A familiar sight—dozens of missing pet flyers, some old, some new. A whole assortment: cats, small dogs, and even a hamster. Then you spot one that makes you pause.

"Is that... a goldfish?"

Mrs. Aster turns to look, squinting. "Oh yes. Poor little thing. Imagine that! A goldfish going missing." She shakes her head. "It used to be just the outdoor cats now and then. But lately, it’s everything. I suppose someone could be collecting them for a zoo." She chuckles at her own joke, but after a moment, her face darkens.

You don’t say anything, but your mind lingers on the strangeness of it.

Mrs. Aster exhales, setting a plate on the drying rack. "You know," she starts, voice softer now, "I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this, but when I first joined the club—oh, I must have been your age—I remember the head gardener, Mr. Hollyhock. You know him from the portrait in the Trophy Room, I’m sure."

You nod.

"He used to say, ‘Don’t wander the grounds at night.’"

Her words settle in the air for a beat.

"I always thought he meant the paths were uneven, or the hills were steep," she continues. "But now, I don’t know…" She trails off, wiping a glass slowly.

You wait, sensing she’s not finished.

"Some nights, I swear, I’d hear things out in the gardens. Branches moving—but there was no wind. And once, I could have sworn I heard something…" She stops, frowning.

"A voice?" you ask.

She hesitates before shaking her head. "Not quite. Not something I could understand, at least. It was like a whisper, but… wrong."

The kitchen suddenly feels smaller, the clinking dishes now the only sound. Then, as if shaking off an old dream, Mrs. Aster sighs.

"Oh, listen to me. I’m just an old woman telling ghost stories," she says with a forced laugh. "Let’s get these dishes done before they pile up again."

But you can’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t just a story.
