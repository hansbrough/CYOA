In the near distance you can see that the trees begin to grow taller and more frequent as the relatively open grass covered spaces give way to generally denser vegetation. The path here narrows and appears little used. An ornate, hand painted sign to the side of the path reads “Botanica Novis closed for regeneration”. You puzzle over the sign momentarily as this certainly does not look like a maintained portion of the club gardens. If anything this looks like wild space left to its own fate free from the guiding hand of order.

Before leaving the open spaces and entering the forest you come across a rocky outcrop around which the path tightly makes its way. Nestled in the rocky crags are several odd looking plants which also look familiar from one of Mr. Watercress’ native plant lectures. “Medusa” plants are what he called them. In the center of each plant was a whitish, calloused looking half dome from which protruded scores of finger-like appendages. Each ‘finger’ was completely covered in a skin of green hexagons which in turn each had a protruding center point. The larger, more mature fingers grew from the bottom edges of the dome while new, brighter green, finger nubs grew from it’s top center. The overall effect was quite alien - even a tad disturbing. To make the situation more bizarre the fingers were able to nimbly adjust their position throughout the day to better orientate toward the sun. Even now you can see the plants moving as if blown in an eldritch breeze. What a fascinating plant.
