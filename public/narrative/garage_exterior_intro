The building appears to be nothing more than a plain cinder block box with a pitched, dull green, metal roof. In the front is a garage door and as you walk around the exterior of the building you see a side door made of metal. You turn the handle but as expected it is locked. Pressing your ear to the door there doesn’t appear to be any noise inside. Around the back of the building are a stack of used, large, plastic, nursery pots and a few of the larger wooden boxes used for growing trees. It seems odd that this place even exists out here but for the moment it looks unused. You can’t help but wonder who owns this place and what it’s used for but there doesn’t seem to be much to see.
