The tree cover is thick on this part of the path. The air is damp and still. The silence is peaceful here with the only noises being those of foraging birds and squirrels. A whitewashed cottage sits off the path, squarely among several mature trees and is easy to miss. It’s wooden door and shutters covered in faded, peeling paint give the place an abandoned, almost ‘antiqued’ look. A small, waist height fence runs in front of the property. It’s gate hang’s askew on a single hinge and is grown through with untrampled weeds. The simple stone path to the front door is barely visible through growth of seasonal plants. The cottage is picturesque in its neglect and you pause for a moment to take in the scene.

Something catches your eye - was that a curtain moving in the window? Instinctively you step behind a nearby bush and try to peer into the window but from this distance it’s difficult to make out details. What’s your next move?
