Glad to get out of that dark room you step through the door into a short passageway which leads to a much bigger chamber filled with bioluminescent fungi which throw off a surprising amount of light. As you continue walking you feel a growing sense of relief; you can’t shake the feeling that somehow you’ve left behind a malevolent presence. Gradually it dawns on you that this is a mineshaft. It just happens to be relatively level at this point. It also smells faintly of burning brakes. To your right you pass what looks like a vehicle ramp which heads up - hopefully to the surface.
