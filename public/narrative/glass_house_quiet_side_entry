You hold the door to make sure it shuts quietly behind you. Through the plants perhaps 15 yards away Mr. Cuttingsworth speaks with one of the full time employees hired by the Garden Club to keep up with the endless list of tasks. From the other direction you hear music. It’s old fashioned sounding instrumental music - maybe from the big band era but to be honest music was never your area of expertise. You definitely feel like an unwelcome intruder and think perhaps it’s best to just end this pointless sneaking around and call out to Mr. Cuttingsworth... on the other hand that might lead to an awkward conversation given you’ve ignored some clearly posted signs.
