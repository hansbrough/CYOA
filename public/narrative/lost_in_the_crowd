Somehow the mystery guest seems to have disappeared into the crowd. Her lines sounded as though they could have been read straight from a fortune cookie, or maybe have been the rehearsed phrases of an amateur tarot card reader. But the way she delivered them was off putting - with a trance like conviction and then nothing... as if she had simply flipped a light switch on the way out of a room.

From nearby came a shout “Where’s my bourbon!”. It was Dr. Loam. You didn’t know how you felt about this man who had apparently been a creative and popular force within the Garden Club for many years. In your estimation he didn’t fall into the “Lovable Drunk” category because he wasn’t particularly likeable or even funny. At Least not in your limited interactions with him since joining. He also was not a “Mean Drunk” - he just seemed sad or maybe “troubled with a dash of self hatred” thrown in was a better way to describe him. The result was you usually tried to avoid situations where a conversation with him might be required. Ironically this made you feel worse - maybe you should talk to him, maybe he needed someone to listen. Suspecting that and doing nothing made you… what? Nothing good. But what could you do, he’s of a different generation, a different time. He’s already had a lifetime of experiences that are still only possibilities in your future. What possibly could you offer that wouldn’t seem trite. Truthfully whatever foul-smelling ichor lay in the heart of his self loathing may not be something you want to know. You have your own problems; everyone has their own problems. You don’t need the burden of someone else’s problems. Still, this decision doesn’t really make you feel any better. You walk away with no particular destination in mind.
