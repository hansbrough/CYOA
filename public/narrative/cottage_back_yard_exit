From the cottage you carefully make your way through the overgrown backyard and hop over the gate which seems to have long since stopped working. Everything about this place seems abandoned - even the little path to the front seems more like a deer track than anything purposely laid out by whomever built the cottage. It’s hard to imagine anyone actually lived here at some point - if anything it feels more like a garden folly. As you stare at the back of the cottage it occurs to you that there are no windows here - in fact the only windows seemed to be at the front of the cottage facing the path. Come to think of it  - there’s nothing resembling a kitchen, or toilet, no closet, no bed - the cottage was really nothing more than a box. What an odd place.
