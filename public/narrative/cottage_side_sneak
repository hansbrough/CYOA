Staying well back from the fence, you circle around the side of the little cottage. Since there are no windows on this side you feel assured that no one will see you. Along the path here grows a thick mat of bluish-green moss which releases an earthy scent as you walk across its surface. The smell is strangely relaxing and while not intoxicating is certainly pleasant. As you slow to a standstill an urgent ( and familiar) pressure builds in the vicinity of your waistline. “Oh no.” you think “What did I eat?” As the earthy smell grows stronger suddenly you are overcome with a need to relieve yourself. In panic and embarrassment while fumbling with your belt you manage an appropriate position for the task at hand. In the moments after finishing the moss seems to spread and grow over the remains of your urgent task.

Dazed, but also oddly refreshed, you continue toward the back of the cottage which is much like the front - a waist high old garden fence, a yard filled with weeds and a door. The main difference being the back wall of the cottage has no windows. Now you must make a decision.
