Standing near the entrance to the hall, arms crossed in a relaxed but ever-watchful stance, is Mr. Shovelton, the club’s Sergeant-at-Arms. Even in casual conversation, he carries himself like a man enforcing an unspoken code of conduct. His crisp shirt is always ironed, his shoes polished, and his expression unreadable behind his square-framed glasses.

As you approach, his eyes flick toward you—not unfriendly, but assessing.

"Miss," he nods in greeting.

You hesitate, then casually ask if he's noticed anything unusual happening around the club lately.

Shovelton scoffs slightly before responding.
"Unusual? This is a garden club, not a criminal enterprise." He adjusts his posture, clearly believing he’s said enough.

But after a pause, he glances around the room and lowers his voice slightly.
"Then again… people have been acting a little different. Members wandering where they normally wouldn’t. Deliveries at odd hours. Can’t say I know much more than that, and frankly, I don’t ask questions unless I’m told to."

His tone remains strictly professional, as if making an observation rather than an accusation. He gives you a pointed look, as if to say: If you don’t want to be on my radar, don’t make yourself my problem.

Satisfied that he’s not in the mood to elaborate, you decide it’s best to move along.
