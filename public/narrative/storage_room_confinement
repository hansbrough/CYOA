Unceremoniously, you are pushed through a door into a small, dark storage room. You hear the lock click behind you.

Your hands fumble in the darkness, brushing against cleaning supplies, empty boxes, and random tools. It smells like dust and chemicals. You try the door—locked, of course.

As your eyes adjust, something catches your attention in the dim light. Half-buried under a pile of crates, something soft and familiar sticks out.

You crouch down, heart pounding, and pull it free.

It’s Rosemary’s silk scarf.

Your breath catches in your throat.
You gave her this scarf for her birthday last year.
She never goes anywhere without it.
There is no way she left it here on purpose.

For the first time, a wave of real fear washes over you.

What happened to her?

You grip the scarf tightly as you redouble your efforts to escape. After several frustrating minutes, you manage to jimmy the door open and slip away into the night.

But now, you know the truth—
Rosemary was here, and she didn’t leave on her own.

As you are running back to the Main Hall for help you have a sudden change of viewpoint; you don’t need this place, it’s people or it’s secrets. None of the other members will believe you anyway. You change direction and run to your car, drive home and happily never step foot in Garden Hall again.

**The End.**
