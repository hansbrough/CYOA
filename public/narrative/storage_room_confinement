Unceremoniously you are pushed through a door into a small room off the glass house cellar. It’s dark inside and filled with items you can’t identify at first but which turn out to be an assortment of cleaning supplies, empty boxes, brooms and random tools etc After some time you manage to successfully “jimmy” open the door and escape.

As you are running back to the Main Hall for help you have a sudden change of viewpoint; you don’t need this place, it’s people or it’s secrets. None of the other members will believe you anyway. You change direction and run to your car, drive home and happily never step foot in Garden Hall again.

The End.
