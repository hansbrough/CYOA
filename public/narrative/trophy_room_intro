Directly off the Garden Clubs Main Hall lies a much smaller room with walls clad floor to ceiling in a dark wainscotting. While the floor space isn’t large the ceiling is the same height as the main hall which lends the room an irregular shape - almost like an elevator shaft. However, the extra wallspace has not gone to waste; a menagerie of paintings and photographs adorn the walls all the way to the ceiling. You recognize photographs of recent, prominent, club members as well as portraits of members from years past and the odd landscape or two. Also on display are several trophies, medals and ribbons won by the club over the years. In fact this room is often informally referred to as the “Trophy Room”. Additionally the space seems to house lots of unusual art and bric-a-brac ranging from fossils, to dried flowers, pottery and even a few small animal skeletons of indiscernible origin mounted and displayed in various lifelike poses.

Hanging on the wall opposite the entrance in pride of place is an exceptional portrait of a dapper looking middle aged man standing with cane in hand amongst a fine display of garden flowers. This you recognize as one of the club’s most celebrated benefactors who donated the many acres that make up the clubs sprawling gardens. Since joining you have not spent much time in this room beyond an initial, cursory tour. You really should get back to your task but this room is so filled with history you are tempted to take a closer look.
