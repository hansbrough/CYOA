Directly off the Garden Club’s Main Hall lies a much smaller room, its walls clad floor to ceiling in dark wainscoting. The space is compact, but the vaulted ceiling makes it feel taller than it should, almost like an old elevator shaft frozen in time.

The walls are crowded with a menagerie of paintings, photographs, and artifacts—a visual patchwork of history. You recognize portraits of prominent club members, faded landscapes, and old photographs of smiling committees.

Among them, a large portrait of a dapper-looking man stands out—his eyes following you no matter where you move. His cane is planted beside him, the garden behind him meticulously arranged. You recognize him instantly—one of the club’s most celebrated benefactors, whose land donation made the gardens what they are today.

Shelves and display cases overflow with medals, trophies, and ribbons, their engraved plaques worn down from decades of polish. Some of them feel strangely new, as if someone has handled them recently.

But what draws your attention most is the bric-a-brac—a collection of oddities that don’t seem to belong here. Dried flowers arranged too perfectly, fossils set next to things they have nothing in common with, and small, mounted animal skeletons posed in eerily lifelike ways.

A small book rests open on one of the shelves, its edges crisp, unlike the dust-covered tomes around it. It looks as if someone was just here.

You really should get back to your task, but this room is so dense with history—and secrets—you can’t help but take a closer look.

Do you…
