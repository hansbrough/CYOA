You walk up the stone path to the front entrance of the greenhouse. Broad stone steps lead to a landing and a set of double doors made of stained glass. The doors are ajar and in the distance you can hear faint music. Through the tropical canopy, at the other end of the greenhouse, you see an outline of someone working. They appear to be dragging something heavy - possibly a large bag of soil. Their muffled conversation makes its way through the plants but because of the distance only a few of the words are audible but hard to understand -  “late lunch” or was that “late for lunch” or “ate brunch”? The figure in the distance stops working, looks up, and begins walking your way - you’ve been spotted. What to do now?
