You walk across the room to the backdoor. Just as you expected it opens to the outside - a ‘backyard’ surrounded by the same dilapidated, waist high fence and filled with seasons of undisturbed weeds and young volunteer trees. It doesn’t look as if anyone has been back here for some time. There is a back gate and a trail leading toward the front of the house.
