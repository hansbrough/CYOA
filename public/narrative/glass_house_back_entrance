Out of breath (why do you always give up exercising?!) you arrive at the back of the greenhouse and notice a set of cellar doors. Upon checking you see they are not locked and decide this will make the perfect hiding spot until it’s safe to slip away back to the Club fundraiser, make a brief appearance and leave early for dinner. With a creak you pull open one of the doors and descend into the darkness below. There’s just enough daylight that you can make out the stone steps that apparently lead to a subfloor beneath the greenhouse. The air is damp and cool; the stone walls are moist and spongy with a layer of moss. On a landing at the bottom of the steps is an old wooden door whose edges are back lit by a source from within. “What in the world is this?!” you wonder. Before you have a chance to mull over the situation voices from outside force you to make a decision. Uh oh, they’ve seen that you’ve left the cellar door open. Here they come!
