The English Garden had always been one of your favorite spots. Unlike the parterre garden’s rigid structure, this space embraced a sense of freedom—a broad green lawn, bordered by drifting swaths of flowers, grasses, and herbs that flowed together rather than standing in strict rows. It was a reaction against control, an attempt to let nature breathe—at least, within the limits of careful curation.

But today, something about it feels… different.

You walk along the soft grass, noticing how the edges seem wilder than before, as if someone had let the perennials overgrow just a little too much. The breeze carries a mix of floral perfume and the earthy scent of damp leaves, the way gardens smell after a light rain.

At the northern end of the garden, an arched gateway leads through the high walls into a small orchard, the branches heavy with ripening fruit. A smaller side arch holds a door leading to the potting shed—a place you know is often locked to non-members. And to the south, another arch opens back into the formal parterre garden.

Then, just as you're about to move on, something catches your eye.

Near the edge of a flowerbed, nestled among the ornamental grasses, is a plant that does not belong here. Its tall, waxy stems and glowing, lantern-like pods sway gently, even though there’s no wind. It looks almost bioluminescent, its pale golden sacs pulsing faintly, as if reacting to the ambient light.

A Lantern Tree sapling. You’ve only seen sketches of it before, in obscure botanical texts, and—

You freeze.

It was in Rosemary’s notebook.

A chill runs through you. Someone planted this here. Deliberately. And whoever it was, they had access to plants that should not exist in any normal garden.
