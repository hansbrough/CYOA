The English Garden has at its center a broad green swath of lawn bordered by drifts of breathtaking flowers, grasses, and herbs. This garden is a reaction against the formal lines and controlled nature of earlier styles which makes it the perfect companion to the parterre garden located next door. Youâ€™ve always loved the flowing masses of plants seemingly free to roam as they wish. There is still structure here. All gardens need some structure but just not so much that it feels stifling.

At the northern end of the garden is an archway leading through the high walls to a small orchard. A smaller arch on the side wall holds a door which you know leads to a utility space for the potting shed. At the southern end of the garden is an archway leading to the formal parterre garden.
