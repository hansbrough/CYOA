Glad to be putting distance between yourself and Mr. Cuttingsworth you continue over the bridge hoping to find whomever else may have been involved in the argument. Walking briskly you see on the trail ahead an older woman walking in the same direction. As you approach the figure it’s soon clearly the form of Mrs. Aster. You call out to her and as she turns you can her eyes are red and puffy. She’s either been crying or is having an allergic reaction. You are pretty sure it’s not the latter. Feeling slightly awkward but also some amount of empathy you ask “Has something happened? Are you ok?” It’s apparent she doesn’t feel like explaining as she heads back in the direction of the club’s main hall while saying. “Thank you dear but there is nothing you can do to help.” You decide it’s best to let her go and not meddle further.
