The club has set up a few folding tables in the corner, serving the basics. A young bartender, who looks like he might be one of the members’ grandsons, nods politely as you approach.

"What can I get you?" he asks, already looking a little bored.

You glance over your options. A large glass of white wine sounds nice. Or maybe a cold beer. Then again, sparkling water might be the safest bet—you still have to navigate this event.

As you decide, you glance around the room again. No sign of Rosemary.

It’s nothing unusual—she’s probably just off talking to someone else—but still, you’d expected her to find you by now.

"Hey—have you seen Rosemary?" you ask, keeping your tone casual. "Figured she’d be around by now."

The bartender pauses for a moment, waiting for your drink order.
