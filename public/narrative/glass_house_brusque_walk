This seems suspicious to you and the time for asking permission has passed. You push past Mr. Cuttingsworth and walk purposely toward the figure in the distance. You pass through several areas of unusual looking plants that you do not have time to examine but still register as worth coming back to some day. One in particular you can’t help but notice because it pops open as you pass - like a “jack in the box”. Another plant, a young tree, has large papery fruit hanging from it’s branches that glow like dim lanterns. You slow down in fascination but feel strong hands grabbing your arms. You turn to see Mr. Cuttingsworth and a workman, both with stern looks. “Blindfold her and take her to the storage closet until I find out what to do.”
