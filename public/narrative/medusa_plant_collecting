Stepping off the path and climbing a short way up the outcropping you look for a suitable stick or other tool to dig out a few of the Medusa Plants from their rocky homes. Before digging your guilt forces you take a last look to make sure no one is watching. The plants have surprisingly deep and tuberous roots which are hard to remove or tear but you are determined and pull more forcefully. To your surprise something firmly wraps around your wrist. It feels scaly and muscular much like a snake. It’s one of the larger plant ‘fingers’. This gives you pause for a moment because it doesn’t make sense that a plant can move with such purpose. Another grabs your ankle but before you can react you see a green blur directly in front of your face and feel a stabbing sensation on your cheek. Almost immediately your hands grow numb and then become locked as if in rigamortis. In short order the feeling advances up your arms. “Oh no…” you think “... this is not good…” The last thing you remember is Mr. Watercress’ warning about disturbing the local flora which apparently wasn’t meant to protect the plants but instead the Garden Club’s members. Your vision goes dark seconds later.

**The End.**
