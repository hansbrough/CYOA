The hum of conversation wraps around you as you step back into the Main Hall. It’s almost comforting—the clinking of glasses, the occasional burst of laughter, the polite murmur of club members discussing their gardens, their vacations, their trivial grievances.

For a moment, you could almost pretend this is just another ordinary social event. That nothing odd has caught your attention. That nothing lingers at the edges of polite conversation, unspoken but ever-present.

And yet, as you glance around the room, you feel a subtle shift in how you see everything now. The club’s traditions, its people, its history. What else have you overlooked?
