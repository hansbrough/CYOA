Walking closer to the main portrait you see a brass label affixed at it’s base with the title “Mr. Hollyhock in the Summer Garden”. The portrait includes a bucolic landscape in the background with rolling hills, and a small whitewashed cottage set next to a grove of trees. Mr. Hollyhock looks the epitome of success, wealth, good taste and a preserved, youthful vigor. In his left hand he holds a cane and cradled in his right hand a book whose title is hard to make out but looks vaguely botanic. On his left hand is also a large ring with a green stone.
