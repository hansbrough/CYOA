The large portrait dominates the wall, its ornate gold frame untouched by time.

A brass label beneath it reads:
“Mr. Hollyhock in the Summer Garden.”

The man in the portrait is everything you’d expect from a wealthy benefactor—poised, confident, a carefully curated image of success.

The background is just as deliberate—rolling hills, a whitewashed cottage, a grove of trees.

Your eyes drift lower—to the book clutched in his right hand.

The title is almost legible, but not quite. Something botanic? A research journal?

And then, your gaze catches on something else.

His left hand, resting lightly on his cane—
A ring, with a deep green stone.
