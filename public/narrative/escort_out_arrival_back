Without a word you exit the vehicle feeling equal parts foolish and indignant. The electric motor whirs and the driver leaves you to stir in your anger. From several feet away a voice asks “Having a rough day? Who was your friend?” Sitting on the stairs leading up to the kitchen’s back entrance is the Bartender. “Shouldn’t you be pouring drinks for the elderly or something else useful?” You respond in a fit of mis-directed, angry snark. With a smile and nod he diffuses your comment with -  “Probably, but I’m done with my shift..” You notice for the first time this guy is around your age and cute in an unconventional kind of “slacker” who could “care less about the world” way. Not really your type at all. Still, right now you could appreciate a good listener.
