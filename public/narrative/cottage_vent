As you lower yourself most of the way into the vent your feet hit what must be a bend in the duct pipe. To get around you’ll have to lower the rest of your body into the ventilation shaft as well but as you twist your body to make the turn your shoulders become wedged. Try as you might you just can’t get around the bend and you can’t get back out since your arms are pinned against your sides and your feet have nothing to push against. You’re stuck and you feel very, very foolish.
