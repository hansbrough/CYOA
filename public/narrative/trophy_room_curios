At first glance, the cluttered shelves look like a haphazard mix of artifacts, books, and forgotten objects—the kind of collection that happens when too many people leave behind things that no one wants to throw away.

But the longer you look, the more you realize: this room is not as random as it appears.

A bookshelf in the corner draws your eye—its tomes thick and ancient, their titles cryptic:

    “Symbiotics in Cryptophytology”
    “A Study of Medusoids”
    “The Plants that Hide from Man”

Even their bindings feel strange, as if they have been handled more often than anything else in the room.

You reach for one, but your hand pauses over a small object—forgotten among a pile of small fossils.

A key.

Old-fashioned, its handle woven in a Medusa-like pattern.

It fits the aesthetic of the room, but something about it feels deliberate, as if someone left it here, waiting.

For whom?

And then you remember—the keyhole in the back of the trophy display case.

Could this be what unlocks it?
