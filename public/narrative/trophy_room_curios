The room is actually cluttered with much more than you first realized. Small artifacts and books are stuffed into every corner and surface which makes the room feel like someone poured the contents of a museum into a jar and shook it vigorously.

In one of the corners is a bookshelf with several old, leather bound tomes. This is not a word you’ve probably ever used outloud but looking at the oversized books it seems appropriate. They have obscure titles such as “Symbiotics in Cryptophytology”, “A Study of Medusoids”, and “The Plants that Hide from Man”. Very arcane topics indeed.

A small old fashioned key looking forgotten among a stack of small fossils catches your attention. It’s a “skeleton” key that probably fit a door that was replaced long ago. It’s head is in a woven pattern resembling Medusa from ancient Greek myths. At one point it surely symbolized something special to someone but that must have been long ago and it certainly wasn’t being used anymore. An impulse strikes you - why shouldn’t you keep the key? No one will notice it missing from the mess of this room.
