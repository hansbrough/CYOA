Mr. Cuttingsworth looks at you for an uncomfortably long moment which is not a little unsettling. “Yes. I see that.” he responds dryly. “We will help you back to Garden Hall.” From behind him one of the full time employees steps forward. “You will be given a ride.” said Mr. Cuttingsworth. “Oh, no” you protest. “Thank you for the offer but I would rather walk back.” Mr. Cuttingsworth is not impressed and says simply “We insist.” You feel a strong hand clasp your arm just above the elbow and pull you in the direction of the exit. “This way please.” says the worker. “Ow! You're hurting me!” you try in an attempt to get free.
