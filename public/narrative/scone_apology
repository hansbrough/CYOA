Ms. Greene’s expression remains unmoved as you place the scones back onto the tray, your fingers brushing off a few stubborn specks of lint that somehow hitched a ride in your bag. Her eyes flick from the scones to you, lips pressed into a thin line, before she gives a slow, disapproving nod—less an acknowledgment and more a silent indictment.

Before the awkwardness can fully settle, a microphone crackles to life from the far end of the room. You turn toward the small stage where the club’s president, a stately woman in a tailored suit, clears her throat.

“I have a short announcement,” she begins, scanning the crowd. “Mrs. Aster seems to have gone missing. Her daughter is here to pick her up, but no one’s seen her for some time. If anyone knows where she might be, please speak up.”

A murmur rolls through the room.

“She was in the kitchen earlier,” someone calls out.

“I saw her in the Trophy Room,” another voice adds.

The president nods. “If a volunteer could help look for her, I’m sure her daughter would appreciate it.”

Without fully thinking it through, you raise your hand. Maybe it’s because you’ve always liked Mrs. Aster—one of the few longtime members who never made you feel out of place. Or maybe it’s just an excuse to step away from Ms. Greene’s scrutiny.

Either way, the question remains: Where should you start?
