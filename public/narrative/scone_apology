From the other end of the room on the club’s small stage you notice the club’s president coming to the microphone. “I have a short announcement.” she begins. “Mrs. Aster seems to have gone missing. Her daughter is here to pick her up. Has anyone seen Mrs Aster recently?” From the audience someone volunteers “She was helping in the kitchen earlier.” Then from someone else “I saw her in the Trophy room a while ago.” The president then asks for a volunteer to help search. Impulsively you raise your hand - perhaps because you have always liked Mrs Aster. Where should you start?
