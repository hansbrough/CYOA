Pushing aside a few of the plastic strips you step through the doorway not knowing what or who to expect. It’s much darker and of course colder. The light from the grow room illuminates the space and you are standing on what appears to be a landing about a dozen feet wide and deep - or is it a loading dock? Walking to the edge of the landing you can make out a small, rough dirt and rock road about 3 feet down. “This must be some kind of a loading bay.” you think. “Where could this road lead?” You are underground so the road and surrounding walls are essentially a long cave or more likely a mine shaft. You don’t intend to venture far into the dark of the road / cave but jump off the platform just to check it out. Taking a few steps into the dark you can feel a very slight breeze and from around a bend see a faint luminescent glow. “Ok” you say to yourself “Let’s just do it.”
