Another Spring, another Garden Club fundraiser. You dread these things, but how do you say no to Rosemary?

Normally, she’d be the first to pull you into the crowd, looping an arm through yours, talking a mile a minute about people you only half remember. But this time?

No sign of her.

You hesitate just inside the entrance, scanning the chatter-heavy room, expecting to hear your name called. Nothing.

Not that you’re worried. Not yet.

She could be working the plant auction or helping in the kitchen—but she usually finds you first. Maybe she figured you'd be late. Fair enough.

You exhale, trying to ease the familiar knot of social anxiety tightening in your ribs. These events make you uncomfortable, and your social skills never seem to work properly in places like this.

Still, you made a deal with yourself—show up, find Rosemary, then you can leave.

At the far end of the hall, a scheduled speaker is preparing to start. The club’s small auction of member-grown plants will begin soon.

To your left, the dessert table is predictably occupied by Ms. Greene, who is undoubtedly regaling some poor soul with the philosophy of apricot scones.

To your right, a young bartender stands behind a makeshift bar, already looking mildly bored.

Where to first?
