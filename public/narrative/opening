Another Spring and another Garden Club fundraiser; you dread these things but how to say no to your best friend Rosemary? You can’t really and that’s why you’re here. In moments of honesty you know these events make you uncomfortable because talking to others has never come easy and very often your contribution to the conversation ends up as snarky one-liners. Besides - the Garden Club has an irritating (and again if you're being honest - somewhat intimidating) social hierarchy in which you land near the level of a “street waif”. As a young grad student studying BioEngineering it seems ridiculous that you should be intimidated by a group of ladies whose main concern is organizing the monthly luncheon. You have a pretty decent understanding of how nature’s system works but not the same level of confidence when it comes to understanding other humans. Your task for the afternoon (at least as you see it) is to find Rosemary so she knows you made an appearance. Then you can leave.

At the far end of the hall you can see one of the scheduled speakers getting ready to start. There should also be a small auction of plants grown here at the club sometime during the day.

The club secretary Ms. Greene has made her apricot scones again this year. Ughh - here comes Dr. Loam. Last year you were forced to listen for an hour while he recited techniques on proper begonia propagation. You must get away before being spotted. You scan the growing crowd for Rosemary but do not see your friend.
