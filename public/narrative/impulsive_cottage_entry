As you step through the front door you realize this was perhaps not the smartest thing you’ve ever done. The room seems empty except for some simple furniture and a particularly pungent smell. But you don’t have time to register more before you catch a shadow out of the corner of your eye and feel an impact on the back of your head. You’ve been hit from behind. As you crumple to the ground you see a crazy looking, long haired, shoeless old man but then everything goes black.

You awake in the dark. A sharp pain at the back of your head is overwhelming. Where are you? How long have you been unconscious? It’s really hard to focus with thudding noise in your head that seems to be in unison with the throbbing pain from where you were hit.

Standing up you stumble along the cold walls looking for a light switch. There is a slight breeze you can feel on your face and then you find a door knob. Unlatching and pulling the door open an other worldly, luminescent glow gently floods what turns out to be the “room” in which you are standing. This looks less like a room and than it does a cave with right angles. Strewn across the floor are blankets, trash, old clothing, books, candles and other odds and ends. The walls appear to be covered floor to ceiling in writing and hand drawn images. The word “watercress” is written and crossed out over and over - scores of times. The images show strange monsters eating all manner of things. Also drawn are trucks moving what look like trees and smaller plants. Men are shown unloading and planting the trees. All of this is surrounded by large amounts of text too small and poorly written to make out clearly in the dim light. The walls are littered with crazy. As your head clears you realize how vulnerable you may be. Whoever left you here could very easily come back.
