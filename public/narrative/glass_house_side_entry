Making your way through the garden around the glass house you see a side door which looks to be used as a work entrance. Outside the door and leaning on the building are several tools such as rakes, shovels, lopping shears as well as an assortment of buckets, gloves and other items you might expect to be used. From the inside you hear a familiar (but unplaceable) voice. The words are muffled and inaudible as if coming from far enough away that the speaker might be in a different part of the greenhouse. Suddenly you feel uneasy about being here without permission.
