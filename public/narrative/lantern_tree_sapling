You step closer to the peculiar plant, your breath catching as you take in the details.

The Lantern Tree sapling stands at waist height, its smooth, waxy stems a pale, unnatural gold. The pods hanging from its branches glow faintly, like paper lanterns lit from within. But it’s not just their soft luminescence that unnerves you—it’s the way they seem to pulse, like breathing organisms rather than simple fruit.

You kneel down, brushing a hand near the plant but not quite touching it. A faint static hum fills the air around it, a barely perceptible vibration that makes the fine hairs on your arm stand up. You've read about plants capable of subtle electrical activity, but nothing quite like this.

This isn’t some ordinary botanical specimen. This wasn’t planted here by accident.

Something about the placement of the sapling unsettles you. It’s too deliberately positioned—not quite hidden, but also not in plain sight. As if someone wanted it to be found, but only by someone paying attention.

The implications churn in your mind. If someone is introducing cryptobotanical specimens into the Garden Club’s carefully curated landscape, what else could be lurking here?

You glance around, half expecting someone to be watching, but the garden is still and quiet. You swallow hard, suddenly feeling very alone.
