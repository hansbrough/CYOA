“You understand...” Mr. Watercress began “.. gardens exist because they are created by someone and their purpose is naturally to please that creator. But just as they owe their existence to a creator - the creator through the very act of creation owes his protection to the garden.” You were beginning to suspect that Mr. Watercress was more than a CryptoBotanist but also a “CryptoLinguist”. You lifted your face slowly to meet his gaze hoping that by the time your eyes met you might understand his meaning. Quickly and with surprising force for an elderly man, Mr. Watercress pushed you over the edge of the path. Cartwheeling down the slope you land with a splash into one of the larger carnivorous plants. It’s lid shuts with a snap and the echoes of your splashing reverberate crazily. You calm momentarily thinking you can easily kick your way out the side but the walls are surprisingly resilient like a giant leather sack. Thousands of thick, downward facing hairs make climbing out very difficult but worse is the slippery liquid which makes grabbing anything impossible. You reach the morbid conclusion that what’s slippery is actually the lipids in your skin dissolving. You scream in growing pain. Relief only comes when you finally pass out. The End.
