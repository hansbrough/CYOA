An older section of the garden estate, often used for summer parties, was the Parterre which consisted of neatly trimmed box hedges shaped into waist-high garden borders. Inside the box hedge borders grew small gardens of plants - oftentimes all of the same type for example lavenders, foxglove, pansies or other ornamentals. Between the borders run gravel paths occasionally lined with an ancient looking, lichen encrusted piece of statuary. The entire garden was surrounded by an old garden wall with the exception of a few entry gates. To the trained eye the final effect was a mini Italian renaissance garden; to your eye it appeared more like a crazy patchwork or maze of chopped up spaces. In either case you knew from personal experience the garden took a lot of volunteer hours to keep it in top shape. This was not your preferred style of garden as it seemed all a bit too contrived and controlling of nature. You had supposed that this assertion of power over nature is what made some people feel safe and perhaps is what initially drew them to the garden style.

The garden wall was composed of mortared rock rubble from the days when the land had been used for mining coal. The wall must stand 10â€™, is periodically reinforced by stone buttresses and has been covered in moss or lichen over the years depending on any particular sections exposure to the sun. Arches of varying sizes pierce the walls in few locations framing views to adjacent garden spaces or utility areas.
