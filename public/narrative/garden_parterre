The **parterre garden**, once a centerpiece of **summer parties**, was now a place of quiet control. Its neatly trimmed **box hedges** formed **waist-high borders**, framing small beds of plants arranged in **rigid patterns**—lavender in one, foxglove in another, then pansies, snapdragons, and rosemary. A perfectionist’s dream, but to you, it felt **unnaturally rigid**, like nature forced into submission.

The gravel paths, lined with **ancient-looking statuary**, crunched underfoot as you walked. Moss and lichen crept over the **old garden wall**, a **10-foot-high relic** of the land’s coal mining past. Arches pierced the wall at intervals, framing glimpses of other sections of the estate.

As you stepped closer to one of the arches, something **odd caught your eye**—a small, **familiar object** lying just at the edge of a hedge. Bending down, you pick it up, feeling a chill run through you. It’s **Rosemary’s leather-bound field notebook.**

You know this for certain—she **never** went anywhere without it. The cover is embossed with her initials, and a faint scuff on the corner is where she once dropped it on a greenhouse floor. But now it’s here, in the parterre, half-tucked into the gravel as if it had been **dropped in a hurry—or left behind unwillingly.**

You flip it open, but the pages are damp from the evening air. Ink has smudged, and many of the notes are unreadable. But a few plant sketches remain visible—detailed drawings of unfamiliar **thick-stemmed plants with curling tendrils.** The last entry, though faded, reads: **"Too late. Already…"** The rest of the ink has bled beyond recognition.

A **soft breeze stirred the hedges**, and for a moment, the tight, **claustrophobic order of the garden** felt suffocating. If the rest of the club was about **curating nature**, this place was about **controlling it completely**—just like its members tried to control everything else.

You turn back to the **arched exit in the wall**, gripping Rosemary’s notebook tightly. She was here. And whatever she had been researching, she never got to finish it.
