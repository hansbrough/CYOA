The mystery guest looks a little skeptical when you mention an introduction to Mr. Cuttingsworth but follows you toward the front door where you see him about to leave.

Generally a quiet man, Mr. Cuttingsworth was diminutive in size and character but was quite knowledgeable on the topic of plant production.
One got the distinct feeling that he was more comfortable in the company of plants than people.
He had a way of avoiding eye contact during conversation that made most people vaguely uncomfortable.
The one exception being upon first meeting when he was prone to a long stare which felt distinctly as if his cold eyes were weighing their specimen for potassium or nitrogen content.

You begin an introduction but are cut short as the mystery guest speaks over you and directly to Mr. Cuttingsworth. “The changes you seek are in motion. Your actions have brought you to this moment. The girl’s actions may bring what you seek going forward.” At this point the mystery guest turned without another word and disappeared into the crowd.
