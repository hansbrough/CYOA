The Garden Club’s orchard is a quiet, sun-dappled stretch of land, neatly arranged with rows of fruit trees—apples, pears, plums—many of which have been here for decades. Some of the oldest trees bear twisted, gnarled trunks, their branches heavy with ripening fruit. The air is sweet with the scent of fallen apples, some of them half-eaten by insects or birds.

You’ve rarely spent much time here—the orchard has always seemed too far removed from the social core of the club. As you wander deeper, your eyes scan the ground for any sign of Rosemary—a misplaced tool, a footprint in the dirt, anything.

Near the back perimeter, where the orchard meets an old utility road, your foot catches on something half-buried beneath the leaves. You crouch down and brush the soil away.

A wooden produce crate, overturned. The club has plenty of these for harvesting fruit, but this one seems recently disturbed, as if someone had set it down hastily. The dirt around it looks scuffed, and something glints faintly beneath the crate’s edge.

You lift the crate and glance at the object beneath it.

A shipping tag, damp and torn at the edges, its barcode smudged with dirt. The words that remain are unmistakable:

"Expedited - Live Botanical Specimen"
"Recipient: CUTTINGSWORTH, H."

A delivery to Mr. Cuttingsworth? That’s odd. What kind of botanical specimen would need to be expedited? And why would it be out here in the orchard instead of the greenhouse or potting shed?
