The Garden Club’s small orchard probably only takes up an acre of land but has over the years been well maintained and provided large amounts of prize winning fruit. Some of the trees are getting old and you’ve heard the Club’s board is thinking about removing them and using the space for solar panels. Going green is all the rage these days.

Along the back perimeter of the orchard runs a dirt road used for utility vehicles. In one direction it heads towards open space and a small copse of trees. In the other direction it heads toward the front entrance of the main hall.
