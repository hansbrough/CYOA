You both wait a few minutes and head up the trail waving and greeting Mr. Watercress with bright smiles as you walk. He seems surprised but waves back and you notice slips the dog leash into his jacket. “Ah, the young scientist and the bartender! Hello! You make an odd couple I wouldn’t have expected to see out in these parts.” With no intention of hiding anything you respond with “We saw some very odd plants down the trail. Fascinating specimens that I’d imagine the broader community would like to see.” Mr. Watercress smiles and motions you to the edge of the path. He points to a group of plants below. You shudder as you realize what fate must have met the poor dog. “I see. Those look like a giant, carnivorous species of plant. In fact they look very much like Pitcher plants.” you respond.

Pointing again he says “You know from here you can see a magnificent view. Tell me young lady, do you believe in God?” And in an instant he produces a cricket bat from nowhere and swings for your head. You half expected some mis-deed and were ready to shift and duck out of reach. His swing puts him off balance momentarily; in the same moment a size 12 boot lands squarely in the middle of Mr. Watercresses back and launches him down the hillside. With a splash he lands directly in a pitcher plant. It’s green leathery sack of fluid is almost as big as a VM bug. From inside you can hear him splash in vain trying to climb out. You look at the bartender and shrug.

“Do you want to look at any more plants?” you ask. “Hmmm… Not really, no.” He responds.
“You know… me either. Hey, you want to get out of here and grab some coffee or something?” you add.

“Sure. sounds good.” he answers.
“By the way I’m Elizabeth. What’s your name?” you ask as an afterthought.

The End.
