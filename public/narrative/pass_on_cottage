That cottage just didn’t sit well with you. You return to your walk. The path winds its way through more tree cover and generally heads uphill for what seems like quite a ways. It’s surprising just how extensive the Garden Club’s property is - in fact maybe you’ve wandered into some adjacent open space? As you crest a hill the trees recede and the view opens to reveal a valley below. At the edge of the valley sits a large glass structure which can only be the Club’s greenhouse which is reassuring given you were starting to feel a tad lost.

To your left off the path in a small clearing is a cinder block building just big enough to accommodate a metal garage door. In front of the building the ground bare of plant life and looks as if vehicles may have recently driven in the area. The path ahead continues into the deep woods.
