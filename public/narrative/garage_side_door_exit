After unlocking the side door you step out of the garage into the fresh air of a pleasant Spring afternoon. The sunshine feels good. Outside the building is about as plain as the inside. It’s a very utilitarian looking cinder block structure with a pitched metal roof. Around the building it looks like some effort was made to clear away brush; in front of the garage door are tracks from the vehicles you saw inside.

A few yards away is a trail running perpendicular to the garage. Once you reach the trail you can see in the distance a small valley and the Garden Club’s large Victorian style greenhouse. It’s surprising just how you seemed to have popped up in the middle of nowhere. To the left the path leads into a heavily forested area and to the right it runs downhill back to the Main Hall - you assume but you are definitely feeling disoriented so it is hard to be certain.
