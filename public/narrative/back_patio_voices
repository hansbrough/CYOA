In the afternoon shadows of a tree some distance away you can make out two people. They seem to be arguing. The first appears to be an older woman pointing a shaking finger at the second and shouting accusatorily. The second person replies, turns abruptly and continues up the path and out of sight. The woman’s shoulder’s drop as she turns and begins heading down the path in your direction. As she draws closer and out of the shadows, you recognize her as Mrs. Aster. Obviously something is wrong; she looks dejected. You decide you’d like to try and help or atleast offer some consolation for whatever happened but once she reaches your position she seems in no mood to talk and continues on by herself.

You decide to turn around as well and continue your short walk.
