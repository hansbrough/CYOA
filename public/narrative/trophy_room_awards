The large display case holds an array of awards spanning decades—from humble ribbons to grandiose silver trophies, the kind you'd expect to see at a European motor race.

One particular trophy catches your eye—polished, heavy, and older than most of the others. Next to it, a small framed photograph shows three young women smiling, clutching the very same trophy. A small brass label reads simply:

“The Sisters.”

The name rings a bell, but you can’t quite place it. The three women look familiar, or maybe just their expressions—triumphant, but with an edge of secrecy.

Beside it, another black-and-white photograph catches your attention. A cricket team, posed stiffly for the camera, their uniforms crisp with age. Some of the faces seem vaguely familiar, but the photo must be from at least 50 or 60 years ago.

Off to the side, a single woman stands apart from the team, dressed in a smartly tailored suit. Unlike the men, she doesn’t smile.

You pick up the frame for a closer look. There’s something about her eyes.

Then, you notice it—a small, keyhole at the back of the display case.

Not just any keyhole, though. The edges look scuffed, as if someone tried to use it recently.

Who? And for what?
