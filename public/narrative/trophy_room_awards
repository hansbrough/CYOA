Set on a large display case are several awards won by the garden club over the decades that range from small ribbons, to framed certificates to grandiose trophy cups better suited to first place in a high stakes, European motor race. Next to one of the trophies is a small framed picture of three, young women smiling and holding the very same trophy. A small brass label reads simply “The Sisters”. Next to it is a framed, black and white picture of a cricket team. Some of the faces look familiar but the image must be from 50 or 60 years ago so you are not certain if the young men in the photo are even alive any more. Standing to the side of the team is a pretty young woman dressed in a suit who looks as if she could be a team manager. You pick up the photograph for a closer look at the woman who looks familiar. Such an old picture it’s hard to tell for certain. Before replacing the image you notice a keyhole in the back of the display case.
