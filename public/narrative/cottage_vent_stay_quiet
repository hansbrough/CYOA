After an hour you begin to wonder if you’ll be rescued from your humiliation. Not many people probably ever walk past this cottage let alone come inside. As you reconsider and are about to yell for help you hear a slow scraping noise. It’s the bookcase swinging from one of it’s corners across the floor to reveal an opening beneath. “Damn!” you think “I wish I knew about that earlier.” From out of the hole reaches a hand, and then the face of a dirty, older man with long hair and yellowish eyes. He looks distinctly unhinged. As he emerges you see his clothes are in tatters and finally as he steps out it’s apparent he has not worn shoes in some time. At this point, positioned as you are, you try your best to shrink back into the vent. You do not feel inclined to ask for help at the moment.

To your relief, after a short time he leaves through the back door mumbling to no one in particular. You can feel the adrenaline running through your system. You lucked out this time but if he comes back you may not be so lucky and will of course be caught in a very compromising position. With these thoughts you redouble your efforts, pushing and wriggling a little harder to the point that you are sure you’ve scraped yourself severely against the metal duct work. Suddenly you manage a foothold and are able to push yourself free. Climbing out of the vent shaking from the exertion you now have a choice.
