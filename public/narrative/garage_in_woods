The ramp twists itâ€™s way upwards. You expect a long climb but within minutes the natural rock walls give way to a large metal culvert which breaks through to the surface. It appears you are now in a cinder block structure that covers the opening. Air vents at the top of the walls let in enough natural light that you can make out a large garage door that takes up most of a wall. Along the wall are also switches which you assume are for the door and possibly lights. You walk to the controls and press a button which turns on the overhead fluorescent lights. The lights flicker to life and their transformers emit a low buzzing sound. Around you leaning on the walls are tools like shovels, picks, digging bars, rakes etc and also assorted empty pots and large wooden boxes - the kind used for small trees. Next to a work bench are parked two electric, golf cart sized vehicles both with truck beds. Also along the wall, near the workbench is a metal door. It seems you have stumbled on another asset of Garden Hall that you had no idea existed. With no desire to go back into the dark you decide the only way is forward.
