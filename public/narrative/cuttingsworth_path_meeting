You decide to cross over the small bridge spanning the creek and begin heading that way. Before reaching the bridge however you see the figure of Mr. Cuttingsworth approaching from the opposite direction. Over his shoulder he carried a bulging sack you assume is filled with samples from the local flora. He was the club’s authority on plant propagation and could often be seen walking alone collecting specimens. He had a way of avoiding eye contact during conversation that had always made you vaguely uncomfortable. Perhaps because of that you’d never made an effort to speak to him beyond a polite greeting. By all accounts speaking with him took no small amount of effort as he seemed more at home with plants than people. Of course meeting on the bridge like this left you both no excuse not to say something beyond just a perfunctory “Hello”.

“Hello Mr. Cuttingsworth. A nice day for collecting material for propagation. See anyone else out walking today?” you say making an effort to sound friendly. Caught now as he is on the narrow path he replies “ Eh? No. No one else. yes. Nice day for it. Good day.” and with his head down, he walks past you toward the garden club’s patio. That was perhaps the longest string of words you had ever heard him utter. “No small achievement” you think. His may have been the voice you heard earlier - he was certainly in the right place at the right time but then again he tends to fall into the ‘usual suspects’ category.

At this point you do not want to follow Mr. Cuttingsworth and risk another conversation. Standing on the bridge this leaves you with only a few options.
